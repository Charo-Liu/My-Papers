## Abstract
In the past decade, China's economy has shown a downward trend. To stimulate the economy and help companies in China survive better, in 2019, the Chinese government chose to implement a large-scale value-added tax reform. The reform mainly includes five aspects: lowering the VAT tax rate, giving additional input VAT deduction for certain industries, allowing excess input tax credits, expanding the scope of VAT deduction and increasing the VAT threshold. Based on the VAT invoice data from the China State Taxation Bureau and the operating data of Chinese listed companies, we examined 
what impact did the VAT reform have on the profitability of listed companies in China. Our findings show that when a company enjoys a higher effective VAT deduction rate in the reform, its profitability performance improves better. In addition, we find that its impact on the profitability of loss-making companies is much high than its impact on profitable companies even when their effective VAT deduction rate decreases by the same level, which  helps to explain why the value-added tax reform is more effective than the corporate income tax reform in helping companies survive.
